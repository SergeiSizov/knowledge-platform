#### Overview

A typical web server can accept connections using HTTP and/or HTTPS protocols.

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext (e.g., web pages) over the internet. HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web, enabling web browsers and servers to exchange information and load resources such as HTML pages, images, videos, and more.
