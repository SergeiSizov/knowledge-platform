## Self Service

* How do the users of the landing zone request a landing zone?

## What is delivered

The definition of a landing zone, from a tenant's perspective, can differ greatly.

It ranges from a single Cloud account to a full set of environments with network connectivity

## Single Cloud Account

* A single, disconnected, set Cloud Account, often referred to as a sandbox account.

## Opinionated set of Environments

For example:

* Dev
* Stage
* Prod
* Management

Where different tenant's landing zone can connect their environments to others in the same environment.

Management can be used to connect to all other environments e.g. to run CI/CD tooling.
