* AWS Account
* GCP Project or Folder with the permission to create projects
* Azure Resource Group

## Organisational Design

* What base organisation setup is required in the Cloud?
* Where do security accounts/projects fit in?
* Are multiple organisations required for the safe deployment of new landing zones?

## Environment Isolation

* What environments will the landing zone be aware of? e.g.
  * Just Prod / non-Prod? 
  * Prod / Stage / Dev?

## Workload Accounts

* What workload accounts are reuqired? What permissions do they need initially?

## Sandbox Accounts

* Do engineers require accounts for experimentation with limited controls and access?
