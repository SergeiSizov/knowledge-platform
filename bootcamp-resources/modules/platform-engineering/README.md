# Platform engineering module
This module includes a reference application which showcases the end solution of the module and a skeleton which is the starting point for a bootcampee when starting the [platform-engineering module](../../../knowledge-base/content/bootcamp/modules/)
## [Reference application](reference/canary-operator/)
Includes a reference application which showcases the an example complete solution.

## [Skeleton application](skeleton/minimal-reference-app-go/)
This is the starting point where we will give bootcampees a starting point to start working on the module. Bootcampees are expected to work on top of this application where they will be able to install necessary dependencies that is required from the module.
